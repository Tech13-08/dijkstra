# dijkstra.py
A python script that uses the dijkstra algorithmn to find the shortest path tree in a tree of nodes

# Text Files
If you want to use text files rather than manually entering the names and values, use the node 0.txt as a template to guide you.
Node names on the left followed by the splitString (which can be changed in the script) and then node values on the right.
